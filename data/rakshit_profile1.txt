Project Portfolio (In-Depth)

1. InstructAware – Instructional Scene Understanding for Visually Impaired
Built at CSU East Bay, this system enhances accessibility through instructional narration generation.
- Object detection via YOLOv8
- OCR extraction using Google ML Kit
- Instructional language generated using RLHF-tuned LLMs (T5, GPT-3.5, DeepSeek)
- Multimodal input processing (image + bounding box + text)
- Evaluation via BLEURT, METEOR, USE, BERTScore, COMET
- Result: End-to-end pipeline generating human-like, contextually aware narrations for low-vision navigation use cases

2. StockSage – NSE Stock Price Prediction Dashboard
An intelligent dashboard to predict next-day close prices for Indian stocks.
- GRU-based time series forecasting for individual tickers
- Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, SMA
- Real-time news from NewsData.io API
- Candlestick visualizations via Plotly
- Personalized caching of models per ticker
- FAISS integration planned for semantic search of financial insights
- Deployed using Flask + Bootstrap frontend

3. SmartSignNavigation (Android App)
Real-time Android app for scanning road signs and shop names.
- Live camera feed processed via CameraX API
