Rakshit Shah is a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer currently based in San Jose, California. He holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from AP Shah Institute of Technology, University of Mumbai, India, where he graduated in June 2023 with an impressive GPA of 8.72 out of 10. Currently, Rakshit is pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at California State University, East Bay, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. He has maintained a strong academic record, achieving a GPA of 3.74 out of 4.00.

Rakshit has cultivated a robust foundation in several programming languages, including Python, R, SQL, Java, and C++. His expertise extends across a wide array of technologies, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, particularly in the areas of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). He is proficient with various machine learning methodologies, encompassing supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, decision trees, and random forest models. His knowledge also spans the use of advanced frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, OpenCV, and YOLO for computer vision tasks.

He has extensive experience with Vector Databases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), specifically using FAISS, Pinecone, and ChromaDB, as well as proficiency in MLOps and model deployment through Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit, and comprehensive CI/CD pipelines. Rakshit is adept at utilizing databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Firebase to effectively manage data.

Professionally, Rakshit has demonstrated significant practical experience. As a Student Assistant in the Computer Science Department at CSU East Bay, he researched and implemented a custom neural network from scratch, developing original algorithms for biases, thresholds, forward, and backward propagation. He also trained advanced YOLO models (YOLOv5 and YOLOv8) for underwater object detection tasks, significantly enhancing detection precision across multiple test scenarios. Rakshit played a pivotal role in troubleshooting image preprocessing and model training bottlenecks, while actively mentoring junior student assistants by assisting them with technical setups and integration issues.

Previously, as a Data Collection Intern at Sciffer Analytics Pvt. Ltd in Pune, India, Rakshit developed automated web scraping tools using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, successfully extracting over 50,000 images to generate high-quality datasets for machine learning applications. His diligent work in building and maintaining annotation pipelines contributed to a notable 15% improvement in YOLO model accuracy. Additionally, he automated critical data processing workflows and collaborated closely with data scientists to enhance dataset quality and resolve labeling discrepancies, further showcasing his leadership capabilities by mentoring junior interns throughout their projects.

Rakshit actively contributes to the technical community through volunteer work. Serving in leadership positions such as Chairperson and Vice Chair at the IEEE APSIT Student Branch from 2021 to 2023, he organized and promoted numerous professional growth initiatives. He also significantly contributed to IEEE Region 10 Symposium and the IEEE Bombay Section Student Activities Committee, enhancing engagement through visually compelling design work as the Design Lead.

His project portfolio includes noteworthy initiatives like "InstructAware," developed at CSU East Bay, where he constructed a Transformer-based scene understanding model aimed at generating instructional narrations for situational awareness, particularly beneficial for low-vision individuals. Rakshit skillfully integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve narrative accuracy. He addressed complex technical issues involving object detection and text extraction, optimizing the systemâ€™s performance using advanced evaluation metrics such as BLEURT, METEOR, COMET, and SBERT+Cosine scoring.

Another innovative project, the "Research Paper Summarizer," utilizes LLMs to efficiently summarize academic research, significantly improving user engagement by accurately extracting and simplifying complex document contents. He also designed a real-time Sign Detection Android App utilizing YOLOv8, Java, OpenCV, and TensorFlow Lite, successfully deploying bounding box detection algorithms and creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface. Additionally, his "Vital Organ Health Prediction" project involved developing advanced machine learning models, including CNNs and logistic regression, to analyze medical data and classify heart health and medical imagery, integrated effectively into interactive Flask-based applications.

Rakshit Shah is deeply passionate about advancing responsible and explainable AI (XAI), demonstrating both practical application and theoretical understanding, underscored by his research publications in IEEE Xplore on Time Series Analysis and Audio Signal Processing. He aims to leverage his robust skill set in Data Science, MLOps, NLP, Generative AI, and Large Language Models in dynamic, innovation-driven organizations.
